# Introduction
*Celtis pumila* Pursh (sensu @Whittemore_2013; *C. tenuifolia* Nutt. in
@Sherman-BroylesEtAl_1997 and earlier authors; Cannabaceae; Dwarf
Hackberry) is a shrub or small tree, native to eastern North America. Its
range consists primarily of the southeastern United States, from Missouri,
Kentucky, and Pennsylvania south to Florida, and from Kansas and Texas east
to the Atlantic Coast [@Sherman-BroylesEtAl_1997]. There are also smaller,
disjunct populations in the Great Lakes regions of Ohio, Indiana, Michigan,
and southern Ontario [@Wagner_1974].

Within this range, *C. pumila* is sympatric with *C. occidentalis* L. in the
north, and *C. laevigata* Willd. in the south. The three species share
several distinctive characteristics: corky ridges on larger stems and
branches; ovate leaves with more-or-less oblique bases; monoecious,
wind-pollinated flowers; and round drupes ca. 1 cm in diamater, with a thin
mesocarp over a hard stone [@Sherman-BroylesEtAl_1997]. *Celtis laevigata*
and *C. occidentalis* are both canopy trees, reaching 30 m in height at
maturity. *Celtis pumila* is limited to the subcanopy, less than 8 m in
height; in open dunes and alvars it forms stunted shrubs less than 2 m
tall. *Celtis laevigata* generally has narrow, elongate, nearly entire
leaves. *Celtis occidentalis* has broader leaves with conspicuously serrate
margins; in contrast, *C. pumila* leaves are shorter, with the lower margins
only sparsely toothed. *Celtis occidentalis* and *C. pumila* can also be
distinguished by the number of major areoles on the leaves: *C. occidentalis*
has 5-8, compared to 3-5 in *C. pumila* [@Wagner_1974].

However, while typical forms of the three species appear quite distinctive,
intermediates abound, displaying combinations of characters that defy ready
identification. Small, vegetative plants are especially challenging to
identify. This variation has resulted in conflicting opinions on the
appropriate taxonomic classification of the group. @Fernald_1950 recognized
three species (*C. occidentalis*, *C. laevigata* and *C. tenuifolia*),
which he divided into eight subspecies based on slight morphological
differences and growth substrate. @GleasonCronquist_1991 maintained the
same three species, but eliminated the subspecies. Furthermore, plants
which @Fernald_1950 placed in *C. occidentalis* (as *C. occidentalis* var.
*pumila*) were subsumed within *C. tenuifolia* by @GleasonCronquist_1991. A
related species, *Celtis reticulata* Torrey, occurs from Texas and Kansas,
where it is sympatric with *C. pumila* and *C. laevigata*, ranging west to
the Pacific coast. *Celtis reticulata* has been treated as a variety of
both *C. occidentalis* and *C. laevigata* [@Sherman-BroylesEtAl_1997].

Many authors have suggested hybridization may be contributing to the
confusion [e.g., @BuckBidlack_1998; @COSEWIC_2003]. Indeed, @Fernald_1950
noted that the three species were often "seemingly confluent". However, in
controlled pollination experiments, @WhittemoreTownsend_2007 were unable to
cross the species. Whittemore has since been able to produce allotetraploid
plants by placing pollen from diploid *C. occidentalis* or *C. laevigata*
on receptive triploid *C. pumila* stigmas (Whittemore pers. comm.). More
data is necessary to determine how frequently such plants occur in nature,
and if they are capable of establishing and producing seed of their own.
Previous taxonomic work on this group has been limited to morphological
data; molecular markers are needed to determine if there is in fact
hybridization and gene flow among these species.

The main questions addressed by this project are: 1) How many genetic
groups of *Celtis* exist in eastern North America, and do they relate
directly to their cytotypes (distinct diploid and triploid groups)? 2) Is
there any evidence of hybridization or gene flow between these groups?

Answering these questions is necessary to resolve the taxonomic
relationships in this group. It is also important to inform conservation
planning. *Celtis pumila* is a Threatened species in Canada, but
uncertainty around its identification and suspicions of hybridization with
*C. occidentalis* present challenges to effective population management.

# Methods

## Field sampling

In May of 2016 and May and June of 2017, we sampled 38 *Celtis* sites
across the eastern United States and southern Canada (Table 1). We also
sampled one location in Texas, including specimens of *C. laevigata* and
*C. reticulata*. Whenever possible, we sampled 20 individuals from a
location, and included the full range of morphological variability present.
A minimum distance of 2 meters between plants was used to reduce the
probability of sampling from the same clone or sibling groups. In total,
381 samples were collected, with sample sizes ranging from 4-30 and
averaging 15 samples per population (mean = 15.24).

For each sample, three leaves were removed and dried with silica gel. These
were stored at room temperature until extraction occurred. Eight samples
were taken from each population for genetic analysis. All samples from
populations with 8 or fewer individuals were included in the genetic
analysis (OHES, INCB, ILHE, MOCC, MSWD).

## Flow Cytometry

We used flow cytometry to assess the ploidy of all of our samples. For each
sample, a 0.7 cm x 0.7 cm piece of leaf tissue was chopped into fine powder
in 750 ul Tris*MgCl2 buffer [@PfosserEtAl_1995] and let stain on ice in
complete darkness for 30 min with 50 uL RNAse and 250 ul Proprodium Iodide
mixed with Galbraith buffer [@GalbraithEtAl_1983]. Samples were then
analyzed with a Gallios Flow Cytomter (Beckman Coulter, Brea, California,
U.S.A.) and compared to petunia and soy standards. The flow cytometry
histograms were analyzed with the ~flowploidy~ R package [@SmithEtAl_2018].

## DNA Extraction and Microsatellite Assays

For each leaf sample, 15 mg of silica was ground with 5 mm stainless steel
beads in a 2 mL Eppendorf tube at 30 Hz for 2 minutes using a Retsch MM 300
Tissue Lyser (Retsch, Haan, Germany). From the ground tissue, genomic DNA
was extracted using the Plant Nucleospin II Genomic DNA Kit (Machery-Nagel,
DÃ¼ren, Germany). Concentration and quality of obtained DNA was verified
using a Nanodrop 2000 UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientif, Walktham,
Massachusetts, U.S.A.).

We used genome-skimming to develop eight nuclear polymorphic microsatellite
markers for use in this study (see Appendix XX). Polymerase Chain Reactions
were carried out with 8 uL master mixes containing 0.24 uL DMSO, 4.0 uL 2X
Phusion Master Mix w/ High Fidelity Buffer (New England Biolabs), 0.416 uL
mix of Left and Right Primers (Sigma-Aldrich, Oakville, ON), 0.192 uL of
FAM or VIC-labelled CAG Tag (10uM), 2.152 uL ddH2O and 1.0 uL DNA, using a
T-100 Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, U.S.A.). The thermal
cycling profile of touchdown PCR (TD-PCR) was used to prevent mispairings
of primers and achieve higher quality amplification [@DonEtAl_1991]. PCR
products were run and observed on a 1% agarose gel stained with GelRed
(Biotium, Hayward, California, U.S.A.) and viewed with a High Performance
UV Transiluminator (UVP, Upland, California, U.S.A.) with a 100 bp DNA
ladder (New England Biolabs) to confirm the presence and size of the
amplicons, along with negative controls for all primer pairs to confirm
absence of contaminants prior to genotyping.

Amplicons were then pooled into groups and visualized by capillary
electrophoresis using a 3500xl Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with
the GeneScan 500 and 1200 LIZ Size Standard (Applied Biosystems).
Individual samples were genotyped with Geneious v11.1.4 software
(Biomatters, Auckland New Zealand) and manually scored. Samples that failed
for three or more SSR loci were dropped from the analysis. A total of 332
samples were genotyped and cytotyped at at least 6 loci.

## Population structure

STRUCTURE analysis [@FalushEtAl_2003] was used to assign the diploid
samples into genetic clusters, and identify possible inter-cluster hybrids.
We excluded triploids and tetraploids from this analysis, as they appear to
be predominantly apomictic (based on displaying limited or no diversity
within populations, see below), and so violate the assumptions of the
STRUCTURE model. As we expected our samples to include at least two
reproductively-isolated species (genetic clusters), we set the model to
leave allele frequencies uncorrelated among clusters. We ran 20 replicates
for each value of K (1-10). Each replicate started with 20,000 burn-in
cycles, followed by 50,000 simulations. We calculated Evannoâs $\Delta$ K
[@EvannoEtAl_2005] to select the most informative number of groups.

We classified individuals with an inferred proportion of admixture greater
than 70% for one of the clusters as members of that species. Individuals
which were not assigned to any cluster with more than 70% probability were
identified as possible hybrids. This threshold was selected arbitrarily.
The results were identical using any threshold between 66 and 72%. Setting
the threshold to 75% results in two additional potential hybrids being
identified, both from populations already identified with the lower
threshold.

We complemented the STRUCTURE analysis with principal coordinate analysis
(PCoA). PCoA is less informative than STRUCTURE, but makes no assumptions
about reproductive biology, so can accommodate samples with a mixture of
sexual diploids and apomictic polyploids. The PCoA was based on Bruvoâs
distance [@BruvoEtAl_2004], as computed by the R package `polysat`
[@ClarkJasieniuk_2011]. Bruvoâs distance incorporates genotypic distances
between individuals of different ploidies, and uses a stepwise mutation
model, as appropriate for microsatellites [@KimuraOta_1975].

## Genetic diversity

The R packages `polysat`, `adegenet` [@Jombart_2008] `poppr`
[@KamvarEtAl_2014] and `hierfstat` [@GoudetJombart_2015], were used to
calculate population-level genetic diversity statistics for the populations
sampled. Observed heterozygosity (He), gene diversity (Hs), and the
inbreeding coefficient (Fis) were calculated only for the diploids, as the
triploid populations appear to be mostly apomictic and so violate the
assumptions underlying F statistics.

Species-level genetic diversity measures were calcualted for diploid
clusters from the STRUCTURE analysis (i.e., *C. occidentalis* and *C.
laevigata*) were calculated, including number of private alleles (Ap),
observed heterozygosity (He), gene diversity (Hs), the inbreeding
coefficient (Fis), and differentiation among populations (Fst).

We used a distance threshold to identify triploid clones, following the
approach of @MeirmansTienderen_2004. PCR artifacts and somatic mutations
may introduce small differences between individuals from the same clonal
lineage. We set the distance threshold based on visual inspection of a
histogram of triploid inter-individual distances.

We calculated pairwise-Fst among diploid clusters and triploid groups to
better characterize their relationships.

Our samples included 171 diploids (DNA-ploidy mean 
`r round(flowSum$dip$mean, 2)` pg, sd `r round(flowSum$dip$sd, 2)`) at 26
locations, 159 triploids (DNA-ploidy mean `r round(flowSum$trip$mean, 2)` pg, sd 
`r round(flowSum$trip$sd, 2)`) at 24 locations, and 2 tetraploids (DNA-ploidy mean 
`r round(flowSum$tet$mean, 2)` pg, sd `r round(flowSum$tet$sd, 2)`) at two
locations (Table 2). 12 of the 26 triploid populations co-occured with
diploids. One of the tetraploids was collected in an otherwise triploid
population, and one was collected from a location with diploids and
triploids.

## Diploid Population Structure

STRUCTURE analysis of the diploid samples indicated they formed two
distinct clusters; the $\Delta$ K value peaked at 2 groups (Figure
\@ref(fig:structure)). Based on field examination of leaf morphology
(unpublished data), and geographic distribution, these clusters correspond
to the species *C. occidentalis* and *C. laevigata*.

There were 97 individuals in the *C. laevigata* cluster, and 63 in the *C.
occidentalis* cluster. Additionally, 11 individuals had an inferred
proportion of ancestry < 70% from both species. We interpreted this as
evidence of potential inter-species hybridization (Figure
\@ref(fig:structure)). These 11 individuals were found in ILHE, ILLG, ILWB
(southern Illinois), INEM (southern Indiana), and MOMA (southern eastern
Missouri). Both *C. laevigata* and *C. occidentalis* were common throughout
this area, and co-occured together with the hybrids at INEM and MOMA
(Figure \@ref(fig:diploid-PCoA)).

Principal Coordinates analysis (PCoA) of the diploids revealed the
intermediate genetic position of the putative hybrids between the two
diploid species (Figure \@ref(fig:diploid-PCoA)). There is no evidence of a
third diploid plant group corresponding to *C. pumila*.

## Triploid Population Structure

The PCoA revealed two geographic clusters of triploids (Figure
\@ref(fig:triploid-clusters)). The northern samples, including Ontario,
northern Ohio, southeastern Michigan, and southern Pennsylvania formed a
relatively tight cluster; the remainder of the samples, including locations
from Indiana and Virginia to Arkansas and Mississippi, formed a looser
cluster. The single population of *C. reticulata* was placed within the
southern triploid cluster.

When the diploids, triploids and tetraploids are combined in a single PCoA,
the diploid hybrids are again placed between the two diploid species
(Figure \@ref(fig:all-pcoa)). The southern triploids form a cloud between
the two diploid species, but with more overlap with the *C. laevigata*
cluster. The northern triploids are contiguous with the southern triploids,
but are more removed from the diploids. The two tetraploids are also in an
intermediate position between the diploids.

## Genetic diversity
When the two diploid clusters (i.e., *C. occidentalis* and *C. laevigata*)
were compared across all 8 loci, *C. occidentalis* had seven private
alleles, and *C. laevigata* had seventeen (Table
\@ref(tab:diploid-diversity)).

```{r diploid-diversity, echo = FALSE}
kable(dipStats, digits = 3,
      caption = "Population diversity summaries for diploid *Celtis* samples")
```

Visual inspection of the triploid inter-individual distances showed a
bimodal distribution (Figure \@ref(fig:triploid-histogram)). We interpreted
the lower mode to represent distances within clonal lineages, caused by PCR
artefacts or somatic mutations. Accordingly, we set a threshold distance of
0.1 in identifying apomictic clones.

```{r triploid-histogram, fig.height = 3.5, fig.width = 3.5, res = 600, fig.cap = "Bruvo Distance among triploid samples", echo = FALSE}
par(mar = c(5, 4, 1, 2))
hist(tripDist, breaks = 40, xlab = "Bruvo's Distance", main = "")
 ```

After applying this threshold, we found a total of 32 triploid multi-locus
genotypes (MLG). 28 of the MLGs were found in a single population each. The
remaining four MLG were found in 2-6 populations each. The same MLG was
shared by all individuals at three Ontario locations (ONGC, 6 individuals;
ONPE, 19 individuals; PPP, 32 individuals), one Michigan location (MIWA, 8
individuals), one Ohio location (OHCQ, 6 individuals); and by one of two
individuals sampled at one Pennsylvania location (PABE). Each of these
locations are part of the northern cluster of *C. pumila*.

Another MLG is shared between two Illinois locations (ILGG, 9 individuals,
and ILHI, 1 individual). A third is shared between an Illinois location
(ILWB, 4 individuals) and a Missouri location (MOCC, 1 individual). The
fourth multi-location MLG is shared between two locations in Missouri
(MOSJ, 4 individuals; and MOGR, two individuals).

The northern triploid cluster, which spans nearly 700 km, has only six
multi-locus genotypes, and there are only three in Ontario. Furthermore,
most of Ontario consists of only one genotype (57 of 61 individuals
sampled). This is in stark contrast to the southern cluster, which has 26
multi-locus genotypes in total, and 12 within 400 km of each other in
Illinois, Missouri and Arkansas. Additionally, with the exception of
Pennsylvania, all of the northern populations have only one MLG per
population, whereas the southern populations have up to five. Thus, there
is greater genetic diversity in the southern region than the northern
region, and greater diversity within individual southern populations than
individual northern populations.

Fst values were calculated between the various species (Table
\@ref(tab:pairwise-fst)). The differentiation between the triploid groups
and each of the diploids is less than the differentiation between the
diploids. The northern triploids are nearly equidistant from both diploids,
while the southern triploids are approximately half the distance from *C.
laevigata* as they are from *C. occidentalis*.

# Discussion

Our analysis reveals two distinct diploid *Celtis* species in eastern North
America, *C. occidentalis* and *C. laevigata*. Typical mature plants are
readily distinguishable based on leaf morphology, and they have largely
distinct ranges. However, where they co-occur, particularly in southern
Illinois, Indiana, and Missouri, we could not reliably identify immature
plants. In fact, our provisional field identifications of samples in this
area were frequently wrong, and were corrected with our SSR fingerprint and
ploidy data. 

While hybridization among *Celtis* taxa has long been suspected in eastern
North America [@Fernald_1950], our data is the strongest evidence to date
supporting this hypothesis. @BuckBidlack_1998 invoked hybridization to
explain inconsistencies in clusters defined by morphological and isozyme
data in *C. laevigata*, *C. occidentalis*, and *C. reticulata*. However,
patterns they observed could also have resulted from plasticity, or lack of
taxonomically informative variation in the markers they employed. In
contrast, @WhittemoreTownsend_2007 were unable to produce any *C.
occidentalis* x *C. laevigata* hybrids in controlled crossing experiments.

The sampling we report here is more extensive than previous studies. Our
structure analysis shows two clear, geographically coherent genetic
clusters, with a small number of intermediates. These intermediate
individuals were all found in locations where both species co-occur in
close proximity, further supporting our view that these are true hybrids.

Notably absent in our diploid data was any indication of a third group
corresponding to *C. pumila*. It's possible that diploid *C. pumila*
exists, but if so, it must be a rare occurence. 

More likely, given our data, is that *C. pumila* is a triploid derived from
both *C. occidentalis* and *C. laevigata*. We have established that these
two species do, at least occasionally, hybridize. Further, the triploids
are placed intermediate to the two diploid species in our PCoA (Figure
\@ref(fig:all-pcoa)), where they cluster with the diploid hybrids; and the
genetic distance (pairwise Fst) between the triploids and the diploids is
smaller than the distance between the diploid species (Table
\$ref(tab:pairwise-fst)).

Such an allotriploid could be formed from two paths: the union of a
reduced and an unreduced gamete from diploid parents of each species
(one-step); or the creation of a diploid hybrid, followed by autotriploidy
(two-step). Interestingly, the pairwise Fst data suggests different
pathways in each of the two triploid clusters. The southern triploids are
twice the distance from *C. occidentalis* (0.104, Table
\$ref(tab:pairwise-fst)) as they are from *C. laevigata*. This is the
expected relationship in the case that an unreduced *C. laevigata* gamete
fused with a reduced *C. occidentalis* gamete. In contrast, the nothern
triploids are equidistant to the two diploid species (0.138 vs 0.135). This
is more consistent with the two-step process, which would result in an
equal mixture of both parent species genomes. 

Alternatively, the differing relationships between the southern and
northern triploids and the diploid species may indicate recent or ongoing
gene flow from the *C. laevigata* to the southern triploids. Recurrent
formation of triploids could be providing a one-way transfer of alleles
from *C. laevigata* to *C. pumila*. This would not be possible in for the
northern triploid populations, which are outside the range of *C.
laevigata*. Further genomic data will be needed to clarify this issue.

occidentalis*, and also north of the northern limit of *C. laevigata*,
indicates that regardless of its origin, it has now established stable
populations indepdendent of its diploid progenitors. Triploid species are
rare, but not unknown, and include widespread species such as *Rubus
canadensis* Linnaeus [@Craig_1960] and *Hieracium lepidulum* Stenstroem
[@ChapmanEtAl_2004]. The conventional viewpoint is that these species, with
predominantly apomictic reproduction, are an evolutionary dead-end
[@StebbinsJr_1950; @ArrigoBarker_2012] and their persistence depends on
recurrent formation from diploid parents. This does not seem to be the case
with either of the aforementioned species, nor *Celtis pumila*. All three
of these species maintain widespread and abundant populations, apparently
independent of their diploid progenitors.

Although our data is limited to a single population of *C. reticulata*, the
placement of those samples within the *C. pumila* cloud indicates the
taxonomy of these two species warrants re-evaluation with more
comprehensive sampling. [need a little more discussion here]

## Conservation Implications

The most recent assessment of *C. pumila* in Canada [@COSEWIC_2003],
suggested that the tree-sized plants (up to 6m tall) growing in
Eastern Ontario forests may be hybrids of *C. occidentalis* and *C.
pumila*, and as such would not warrant legal protection. We have confirmed
that these plants are in fact part of the same *C. pumila* cluster as in
southwestern Ontario. In fact, most of the plants in eastern Ontario, which
are subcanopy trees, share the same MLG as plants in southwestern Ontario,
which includes a mix of dwarf forms (< 2 m tall) and taller trees.
